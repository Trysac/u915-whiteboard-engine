Whiteboard engine core: shapes in a last-writer-wins replicated scene, camera zoom and pan, grid-indexed hit testing, selection, undo and exact SVG export

## Problem

Describe in two or three sentences the concrete problem this utility solves, who hits it, and why existing
packages do not solve it well. Keep it factual; link to an issue or decision record when there is one.

## Install

```sh
npm install @trysac/whiteboard-engine
```

Requires Node.js 20 or newer. The package ships ES modules with TypeScript declarations.

## Usage

```ts
import { greet } from "@trysac/whiteboard-engine";

// Build a greeting; surrounding whitespace is ignored.
const message = greet("  Ada ");
console.log(message); // "Hello, Ada!"

try {
  greet("   ");
} catch (error) {
  console.error((error as Error).message); // "name must not be empty"
}
```

## API

| Export | Signature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `greet` | `(name: string) => string` | Placeholder API; replace it with the real one. |

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm run check   # lint, format, types, tests with coverage, docs, secrets
```
